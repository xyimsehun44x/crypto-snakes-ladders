# Discord Integration Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Your Discord App Configuration

**Application Details:**
- **Client ID**: `1414845018161676339`
- **Client Secret**: `TtOWzTBYF6_2_dJ3hrkqVx1jFqyJ6Ib_`
- **Redirect URIs**: Dynamic - works on any localhost port

## üîß Complete Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Discord Application Settings

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your application (ID: 1414845018161676339)
3. Navigate to **OAuth2** ‚Üí **General**
4. Under **Redirects**, add these URLs for flexible localhost support:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/auth/discord/callback
   http://localhost:5174/auth/discord/callback
   http://localhost:3000/auth/discord/callback
   http://localhost:8080/auth/discord/callback
   ```
   üí° **Pro tip**: Add common dev ports so it works on any localhost setup!
5. Under **Scopes**, ensure you have:
   - `identify` (to get user profile)
   - `email` (optional, for email access)

### Step 2: Environment Setup ‚úÖ (Already Done)

Your `.env` file has been created with:
```env
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=1414845018161676339
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=TtOWzTBYF6_2_dJ3hrkqVx1jFqyJ6Ib_

# Redirect URI is now dynamic - works on any localhost port!
# No need to specify DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI
```

üéâ **The app now automatically detects your current localhost port and uses the correct redirect URI!**

### Step 3: Test the Integration

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   cd crypto-snakes-ladders
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application on any port:**
   - `http://localhost:5173` ‚úÖ 
   - `http://localhost:5174` ‚úÖ
   - `http://localhost:3000` ‚úÖ
   - `http://localhost:8080` ‚úÖ
   - Any other localhost port works too!

3. **Test Discord Login:**
   - Click "Connect Discord" button
   - Use the "üé≠ Demo Discord Profile (Test)" button for quick testing
   - Or use the real Discord OAuth flow

### Step 4: Features You Can Now Use

- Discord avatars displayed on game board
- Username from Discord shown in player list

## üîí Security Notes

- Client Secret is embedded for demo purposes
- In production, handle OAuth on server-side
- Never expose client secrets in frontend code
- Use environment variables properly

## üöÄ Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. **Update Redirect URI:**
   - Add your production domain to Discord app
   - Example: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/discord/callback`

2. **Environment Variables:**
   ```env
   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=1414845018161676339
   DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=TtOWzTBYF6_2_dJ3hrkqVx1jFqyJ6Ib_
   DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/auth/discord/callback
   ```

3. **Server-Side OAuth:**
   - Move token exchange to backend
   - Keep client secret secure
   - Add proper session management

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid Redirect URI"**
   - Check Discord app settings
   - Ensure exact URL match including port

2. **CORS Errors**
   - Verify redirect URI is registered
   - Check browser console for details

3. **Demo Button Not Working**
   - Check browser console
   - Ensure profile hooks are working

4. **Avatar Not Loading**
   - Discord CDN URLs may be invalid
